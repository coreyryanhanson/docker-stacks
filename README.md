# AnaCUDA

A minimally changed fork of [Jupyter's Docker Stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) that switches the base image from Ubuntu 18 to it's [CUDA enabled counterpart](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda) from the NVIDA dockerhub repo.

Jupyter Docker Stacks are a set of ready-to-run [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/jupyter)
containing Jupyter applications and interactive computing tools.

## \*\*Note\*\*
Most of the original code is left as is for easy maintenance.
